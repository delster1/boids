# Boids
This is a project where I'm aiming to implement boids using rust, I'm currently using webassembly, but might switch to a different framework (for speed, I don't wanna send everything over to wasm over and over)...
**goals**
- Implement boids
- Wrap-around edge of screen
- Mouse Interaction with boids
- Sliders for valid boid parameters
